# We will most likely need a population script so that we can work with the same data.

# We have to import project's settings. When creating the script, uncomment the following lines first:
#   import os
#   os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'zombies_on_campus.settings')

# These two lines import the Django settings. Uncomment these as well
# (otherwise will not allow to import our models)
#   import django
#   django.setup()

# Finally, uncomment and edit this line
#   from zombies.models import <model 1> <model 2> ... <model n>

# After this is done, population script can be written.

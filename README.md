<h4>To do: </h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Couple of tests</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Deployment</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Add proper stories.</strong></li>
    <li>Add a way for user to upload his/her profile picture</li>
    <li>Display a profile picture that the user has uploaded</li>
    <li>If the user enters a username that already exists, he/she is shown 
    the same page again. Should not be this way. Should show an error 
    message, or something that would let one know what is happening</li>
    <li>CSS for all links. Transparent background, etc.</li>
    <li>Make buttons nicer - perhaps transparent?</li>
    <li><strong>Profile HTML missing error when clicking on some user??</strong>
</ol>

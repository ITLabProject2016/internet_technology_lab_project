<h4>To do: </h4>
<ul>
    <li>Got some csrf errors when logging in (once). Need to figure out
    if it was a bug in our code or something just hiccuped.</li>
    <li>Could add a little house as our "home" icon? I think they look
    quite neat.</li>
    <li>Add proper stories.</li>
    <li>Do we want to show all stories at once? We could have a 
    massive "play" button, and after clicking it the user would be
    shown a random story.</li>
    <li>User stats. E.g., how many stories completed, etc.</li>
    <li>Global stats. For example, how many deaths in total, how many
    marriages, that kind of stuff. We could add "ending" variable,
    which would indicate the ending, then simply check it and
    increment the counter when the appropriate ending is reached.</li>
    <li>Profile picture. Also, can we show it in the toolbar? CSS may 
    need to change a bit if we decide to go for it, though (unless
    profile pic is really small).</li>
    <li>Make form fields more visually appealing.</li>
    <li>If the user enters a username that already exists, he/she is
    shown the same page again. Should not be this way</li>
    <li>Password change form needs to be updated. What are the form
    parameters though?</li>
</ul>

<h1>Zombies on Campus</h1>

<h3>Internet Technology Lab Project, University of Glasgow, 2016</h3>

<h4>To do: </h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Couple of tests</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Deployment</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Add proper stories.</strong></li>
    <li><storng>Upload pictures to the stories.</storng></li>
    <li>Story images should be in static folder, not media. Media is for user uploaded files.</li>
    <li>Fix user dropdown list to be consistent with other design</li>
    <li>If the user enters a username that already exists, he/she is shown the same page again. Should not be this way.
        Should show an error message, or something that would let one know what is happening.</li>
    <li>Buttons - make them exactly the same in all of the pages.</li>
    <li>Links - make them exactly the same everywhere they can be found.</li>
    <li>Instead of pictures & text in the index page, make them pictures of locations.</li>
    <li>Play another story/play again should look the same - and probably not as squished together</li>
    <li>Do we need "Zombies on Campus" in the header? Perhaps some kind of logo/glyphicon would do?</li>
    <li>Add 'About' page.</li>
    <li>User dropdown is kind of overtaken by about button/link (the edges overlap)</li>
    <li>Reduce the size of storypoints' pictures</li>
    <li>Stats colours/style</li>
    <li>Profile colours/style</li>
    <li>Login font and style</li>
</ol>

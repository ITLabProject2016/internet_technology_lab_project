<h1>Zombies on Campus</h1>

<h3>Internet Technology Lab Project, University of Glasgow, 2016</h3>

<h4>To do: </h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Couple of tests</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Deployment</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Add proper stories.</strong></li>
    <li>Stats' background picture looks slightly smaller compared to other
    links in our project (e.g., see the change when going from profile 
    to stats). For some reason background image becomes smaller</li> 
    <li>Add a way for user to upload his/her profile picture</li>
    <li>Display a profile picture that the user has uploaded</li>
    <li>If the user enters a username that already exists, he/she is shown 
    the same page again. Should not be this way. Should show an error 
    message, or something that would let one know what is happening</li>
    <li>CSS for all links. Transparent background, etc.</li>
    <li>Some indication on where the user is in the story?</li>
    <li>Stats not working properly - zombies in space does not show up
    in the pie chart :( </li>
</ol>

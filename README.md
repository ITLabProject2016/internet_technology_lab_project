<h4>To do: </h4>
<ul>
    <li>Got some csrf errors when logging in (once). Need to figure out
    <li>Add proper stories.</li>
    <li>Do we want to show all stories at once? We could have a 
    big "play" button, and after clicking it the user would be
    shown a random story. Above it - login form/buttons</li>
    <li>More user stats: deaths, marriages, heroic deeds, etc.</li>
    <li>More global stats</li>
    <li>Profile picture. At the moment user profile has only a stub - 
    need to figure out a way how to connect registration redux with 
    the custom attributes.</li>
    <li>Make form fields more visually appealing.</li>
    <li>If the user enters a username that already exists, he/she is
    shown the same page again. Should not be this way.</li>
    <li>Password change form needs to be updated. What are the form
    parameters though? No idea, registration redux is really badly 
    documented.</li>
    <li>Header - not black, just overlay on the wallpaper</li>
    <li>Random stories instead of a list?</li>
</ul>
